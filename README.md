# Java Programming Workbook

## Overview
The Java Programming Workbook is created to complement active learning methods using a series of exercises. Unlike traditional textbooks, this workbook focuses on practice and application with little explanatory text. This workbook is designed to be used in an active learning environment where students access content through videos or other texts. Each exercise is meant to be completed within a class period, making it ideal for in-class activities.

## Objectives
The goal of this workbook is to help you develop your Java programming skills through practice. Exercises are available in three levels for each topic:
- **Starter Exercises**: Highly scaffolded exercises
- **Growth Exercises**: Moderately scaffolded exercises
- **Stretch Exercises**: Lightly scaffolded exercises

## Expected Background
This workbook is intended for students who have completed an introductory course in Java programming. If you are new to Java or need a refresher, the **Java Basics** chapter contains exercises to get you up to speed. However, if your introductory course was "Objects-First," you may find some of the exercises in this chapter to be less challenging.

## Development History
The first edition of this workbook was created in the Spring and Summer of 2024 at the University of Manitoba, by **Dr. Celine Latulipe**, PhD student **Devon Blewett** and undergraduate student **Lara De Leon**, with funding from the University of Manitoba Libraries Open Educational Resources board.
